Ordered pair: \math (a,b) = (a',b') \Leftrightarrow (a=a' \wedge b=b')\)
\newline Set formed by ordered pairs \math (a,b)\) with a \in A\) and b \in B\) is called Cartesian product of A and B: A x B = \math \{(a,b)\vert a \in A, b \in B\}\)
\newline When A = B, we denote A x A by A^2\), extends to n-tuple
\\
\\
Cartesian coordinates: \math(x,y,z) \in \Re^3\)
\newline Distance between 2 points \math \triangle ($M_1$,$M_1$) = \sqrt{($x_1$-$x_2$)^2+($y_1$-$y_2$)^2+($z_1$-$z_2$)^2}\)
\\
\\
Polar coordinates: \math(r,\phi) \in \Re^2\)
\newline X-axis is polar axis, r is radial distance/radius, \phi\) is polar angle/azimuth, pole is the origin (any pair with r = 0)
\newline Therefore, ($r_0$,$\phi_0$) corresponds to r = $r_0$ and \phi = $\phi_0$ + 2n\pi\), n is arbitrary integer
\newline Possess uniqueness when \math r > 0\) and -\pi < \phi \leq \pi\), usually r \geq\) 0 with r \in \Re\) and \phi \in (-\pi,\pi]\)
\\
\\
Cylindrical coordinates: \math(\rho,\phi,z) \in \Re^3\)
\newline Spherical coordinates: \math(r,\phi,\theta) \in \Re^3\), such that r \geq 0, \phi \in (-\pi,\pi]\) and \theta \in (0,\pi]\)
\\
\\
An equation \math f(x,y,z) = 0\) is a cartesian equation of a part of \Re^3\) denoted by A if we have the equivalence: \math M(x,y,z) \in A \Leftrightarrow f(x,y,z) = 0 \)
\newline Many different cartesian equations can specify same subset A of \Re^3\)
\newline Every cartesian equation lowers dimensionality by one (unless constraints are related or are incompatible)
\\
\\
\math f(r,\phi) = 0\) in \Re^2\) is a polar equation of a part of a plane A if: a point M is a point of A if and only if one of its systems of polar coordinates verifies \math f(r,\phi) = 0
\\
\\
f(r,\phi,\theta) = 0\) is a spherical equation for a part A of \Re^3\) if: a point M is a point of A if and only if one of its systems of spherical coordinates verifies \math f(r,\phi,\theta) = 0\)
\\
\\
Definition of a curve/surface as a set of points that fulfil a set of constraints is called implicit definition
\newline Could have different parameterisations (e.g cartesian to polar coordinates)
\\
\\
2-dimensional subset of \Re^3\) is obtained by defining coordinates as functions of 2 parameters. Curve is obtained by expressing all coordinates as functions of one of the parameters. Can obtain a cartesian equation by eliminating the parameter(s).
\\
\\
For a given curve there are infinitely many possible parameterisations, if we view parameter t as time. Same curve could be traversed slower or faster in specific places.
\\
\\
Line \math L\) going through point P with cartesian ($x_0$,$y_0$) and slope \alpha\) can be parameterised as:
\left\{ \begin{array}{rcl}\math x = $x_0$+\lambda & \mbox{with} & \lambda \in \Re \\ y = $y_0$+\lambda \alpha \end{array}\right
\)
\newline Our parameterisation is the map \lambda \mapsto (x(\lambda), y(\lambda))\), the real \lambda\) is the parameter (changing to 2\lambda\) or \lambda^3\) changes the parameterisation)
\\
\\
Any line \math L\) in \Re^2\) can be represented as set of (x,y) fulfiling: \math ax + by + c = 0\) with (a,b) \neq (0,0)\)
\newline Any such equation represents a line, 2 such equations represent same line if they are proportional to each other.
\\
\\
Line that goes through pole defined by the polar equation: \theta = $\theta_0$ with $\theta_0$ \in \Re\)
\\
\\
Line that doesn't pass through pole: \math r = 1/(\alpha cos(\theta)+\beta cos(\theta))\) with (\alpha,\beta) \neq (0,0)
\newline \alpha \cdot r cos(\theta) + \beta \cdot r cos(\theta) = c\) (only pass through origin if c = 0, but then we can't obtain original result)
\\
\\
Set of points with cartesian \math (x,y,z)\) defined as:
\left\{ \begin{array}{rcl}\math x = $x_0$+\lambda $u_1$+\mu $v_1$ & \mbox{with} & \lambda \in \Re \\ y = $y_0$ + \lambda $u_2$ + \mu $v_2$ \\ z = $z_0$ + \lambda $u_3$ + \mu $v_3$ \end{array}\right\)
\newline Where $u_j$ \in \Re\) and $v_j$ \in \Re\) are fixed constants, form a plane in \Re^3\), containing the point with coordinates \math ($x_0$,$y_0$,$z_0$)\)
\\
\\
Parameters \lamba\) and \mu\) can be used as coordinates in the plane \math (\lambda,\mu) \in \Re^2
\newline ax + by + cz + d = 0\), where \math (a,b,c) \neq (0,0,0)\) defines planes in \Re^3\)
\\
\\
set of points with cartesian \math (x,y,z)\) defined as:
\left\{ \begin{array}{rcl}\math x = $x_0$+\lambda $u_1$ & \mbox{with} & \lambda \in \Re \\ y = $y_0$ + \lambda $u_2$ \\ z = $z_0$ + \lambda $u_3$ \end{array}\right\)
\newline Where $u_j$ \in \Re\) are fixed constants, form a line in \Re^3, passing through the point with coordinates \math($x_0$,$y_0$,$z_0$)\)
\\
\\
Intersection of 2 non-parallel planes as the sets of points fulfilling: \math
\newline $a_1$x + $b_1$y + $c_1$z + $d_1$ = 0
\newline $a_2$x + $b_2$y + $c_2$z + $d_2$ = 0\)
\newline Where \math ($a_j$,$b_j$,$c_j$) \neq (0,0,0)\) and no such real number \alpha\) such that \math ($a_1$,$b_1$,$c_1$) = \alpha($a_2$,$b_2$,$c_2$)\), define lines in \Re^3\)
\\
\\
Given a point (focus) and a line not containing this point (directrix), set of points for which the ratio of the distances to the focus and the directrix is e \in \Re^>\) (eccentricity)

- ellipse when \math e < 1\)

- parabola when \math e = 1\)

- hyperbola when \math e >1\)

Special case for which \math e = 0\) (directrix at infinity) is a circle
\\
\\
Cartesian equation of conic section: \math Ax^2 + Bxy + Cy^2 + Dx + Ey + F = 0\), where A,B,C,D,E,F \in \Re  \triangle := B^2 - 4AC\)

- ellipse for \triangle < 0\)

- parabola for \triangle = 0\)

- hyperbola for \triangle > 0\)
\\
\\
Polar equation of conic section with one focus at the pole: \math r = 1/(1+e cos(\phi + $\phi_0$))\) where \math e,l \in \Re e\) is eccentricity, \math l\) is semi-latus rectus (length of straight line between focus and conic section along direction parallel to directrix)
\\
\\
Circular cone: \math x^2 + y^2 - k^2z^2 = 0\)
\\
\\
Kepler's first law: The planets orbit around the sun on elliptical orbits with the sun in one of the focal points.
\newline Kepler's second law: The line connecting the sun and the sun and the planet sweeps equal areas of space during equal time intervals.
\newline Kepler's third law: The squares of the orbital periods of the planets are proportional to the cubes of the semi-major axes of their orbits.
\\
\\
Position: \math (x,y,z) \in \Re^3\)
\newline Velocity: \math ($v_x$,$v_y$,$v_z$) = (\.{x},\.{y},\.{z})\)
\newline Momentum: \math $p_j$ = m$v_j$
\\
\\
Newton's second law in vector form: \.{p} = F\), where F is external force on "body"/"particle"
\newline Solution \math (x(t),y(t),z(t))\) is called trajectory of particle
\\
\\
Any complex number \math z = x + iy\) (with \math x,y \in \Re\)) can be expressed as \math z = re^i\theta\), with \math r \in \Re^>\) and \phi \in \Re
\newline r = \vert z \vert, \vert z \vert = \math sqrt(x^2+y^2)\) (modulus of z)
\newline \phi = -i ln(z/\vert z \vert)\) (argument or phase of z)
\\
\\
\math $z_1$$z_2$ = $r_1$$r_2$e^i($\phi_1$+$\phi_2$)\)
\newline Multiplying a complex number with unit length $r_2$ = 1 thus amounts to a rotation in the plane around the origin by an angle $\phi_2$ \)

- two rotations amount to one
- rotations are commutative
\\
\\
\math i^2 = j^2 = k^2 = ijk = -1 \)
\newline A quaternion q is then an object of the form \math q = $q_0$+i$q_1$+j$q_2$+k$q_3$\) with \math $q_0,1,2,3$ \in \Re\)
\\
\\
Any point U in \Re^3\) with cartesian coordinates \math ($u_1$,$u_2$,$u_3$) \in \Re^3\) as representing a vector, that points from the origin of the coordinate system to the point U.
\newline Alternate interpretation: translation that maps an arbitrary point \math (x,y,z)\) to \math (x+$u_1$,y+$u_2$,z+$u_3$)\)
\\
\\
Individual real numbers \alpha \in \Re\) are called scalars
\\
\\
\vert u \vert = sqrt($u_1$^2,$u_2$^2,$u_3$^2)\) (euclidean norm)
\newline "normalised", \vert u \vert = 1 = \hat{u}\), unit vector
\newline \math(0,0,0)\) is called a zero vector
\\
\\
vector \math u = ($u_1$,$u_2$,$u_3$) \in \Re^3\) and real number \lambda\) (a scalar), scalar multiplication
\newline \math \lambda u = (\lambda$u_1$,\lambda$u_2$,l\ambda$u_3$)
\newline \therefore \vert \lambda u \vert = \vert \lambda \vert \vert u \vert\) (associative and commutative)

- \lambda u\) traces out a straight line passing through origin and point u
- if \lambda = -1\), we write \math -u = (-$u_1$,...,-$u_n$)\) exact inverse of translation by u
- with 1/\vert u \vert = \lambda, 1/\vert u \vert u = \hat{u}\)
- with \lambda = 0, 0u = 0\) turns into zero vector
\\
\\
Addition and subtraction is done component wise, commutative, associative and distributive
\\
\\
\vert u+v \vert^2 + \vert u-v \vert^2 = 2\vert u\vert^2 + 2\vert v \vert^2\)
\\
\\
Let $u_j$ \in \Re^3\) (with \math j \in $\mathb{N}$\) and \math j < N\)) be vectors and $a_j$ be scalars. The vector:
\newline \math v = \sum_{j=0}^{N} $a_j$$u_j$ \)
\newline Is a linear combination of the vectors $u_j$. $a_j$ are the coefficients.
\\
\\
A set of N vectors {$u_j$} is called linearly independent if no non-trivial linear combination (not all coefficients are 0) of them sums to 0. On the contrary, called linearly dependent if at least one of the vectors in the set as a linear combination of the others: \math $u_k$ = \sum_{j \neq k}$a_j$$u_j$\) (n vectors going in different directions are able to go to any point in n-dimensions)
\\
\\
A set of three vectors a, b, c is a basis of \Re^3\), if any vector \math u \in \Re^3\) can be expressed as a unique linear superposition of a, b and c:
\newline \math u = $u_a$a+$u_b$b+$u_c$c\)

- represents a vector by list of its coefficients in a given basis
- any set of 3 linearly independent vectors $a_j$ in \Re^3\) is a basis of \Re^3\)
\\
\\
Standard basis of \Re^3: (1,0,0),(0,1,0),(0,0,1) \hat{$e_1$} \hat{$e_2$} \hat{$e_3$}\)
\\
\\
Det: (\Re^n\))^n \rightarrow \Re\), fulfils following properties:

- linearity in each argument
- antisymmetry with respect to interchange of arguments
\newline To make determinant uniquely defined, pick a basis {$u_j$} and set det($u_1$,...,$u_n$) = 1
\newline (THINK ABOUT THE POSITIVE CYCLE OF 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 1 TO DETERMINE SIGNS)
\newline \math det(u,v) = $u_1$$v_2$-$u_2$$v_1$
\newline det(u,v,w) = $u_1$$v_2$$w_3$+$u_2$$v_3$$w_1$+$u_3$$v_1$$w_2$-$u_3$$v_2$$w_1$-$u_2$$v_1$$w_3$-$u_1$$v_3$$w_2$\)
\\
\\
Determinant of n non-zero vectors is zero if and only if the vectors are linearly dependent. Proof:
\newline If 2 vectors are linearly dependent:

\math det(u,v) = \alpha det(v,v) = 0 \)
\newline suppose neither u or v are 0 and are linearly independent, then:

\newline \math \hat{$e_1$} = $\alpha_1$u+$\beta_1$v\), and \hat{$e_2$} = $\alpha_2$u+$\beta_2$v\) where \math det(u,v) = 0\)
\newline Using bi-linearity of determinant:

\math det(\hat{$e_1$},\hat{$e_2$}) = $\alpha_1$$\alpha_2$det(u,u)+$\alpha_1$$\beta_2$det(u,v)+$\alpha_2$$\beta_1$det(v,u)+$\beta_1$$\beta_2$det(v,v)
= 0\)
\newline Which is a contradiction since \math det(\hat{$e_1$},\hat{$e_2$}) = 1\) so if \math det(u,v) = 0\), then u, v are linearly dependent
\\
\\
Let \math u = \alpha v+\beta w

det(u,v,w) = \alpha det(v,v,w)+\beta det(w,v,w)=0\)
\\
\\
Dot product: \math u \cdot v = \vert u \vert \vert v \vert cos(\phi) = $u_1$$v_1$+$u_2$$v_2$+$u_3$$v_3$\)
\newline a) \math u \cdot v = v \cdot u\) (symmetry)
\newline b) \math (\lambda u+ \mu w) \cdot v = \lambda u \cdot v+\mu w \cdot v\) (linearity in first argument)
\newline c) \math u \cdot (\lambda v + \mu w) = \lambda u \cdot v + \mu u \cdot w\) (linearity in second argument)
\newline d) \math u \cdot u \geq 0\) and \math u \cdot u=0 \Leftrightarrow u=0\)
\\
\\
Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality: let u and v be 2 vectors in \Re^3\), then:

\math \vert u \cdot v \vert \leq \vert u \vert \vert v \vert \)
\newline With equality when u and v are linearly dependent
\\
\\
Triangle Inequality: let u and v be 2 vectors in \Re^3\), then:

\math \vert u+v \vert \leq \vert u \vert + \vert v \vert\)
\\
\\
Let u and v be vectors in \Re^3\) with v \neq 0\), there is a unique real \lambda\) such that \math u-\lambda v\) is perpendicular to v: \math u = \lambda v + (u-\lambda v)

\lambda = (u \cdot v)/(\vert v \vert^2)

$proj_v$u = (u \cdot v)/(\vert v \vert^2) v\)
\\
\\
A set of vectors {$u_j$} is said to be orthonormal if each vector is normalised and pairwise orthogonal

\math $u_j$ \cdot $u_k$ = $\delta_jk$ \)
\newline Kronecker symbol $\delta_jk$ = \left\{ \begin{arrary}{rcl} 1 & if j=k \\ 0 & otherwise \end{array}\right\)
\\
\\
Basis composed of orthonormal vectors is an orthonormal basis

- set of three orthonormal vectors in \Re^3\) forms a basis
- if {$w_1$,$w_2$,$w_3$} is an orthonormal basis of \Re^3\) and \math u = $\alpha_1$$w_1$+$\alpha_2$$w_2$+$\alpha_3$$w_3$\) then \math $a_j$ = u \cdot $w_j$\)
\\
\\
Given 2 vectors u and v in \Re^3\) and orthonormal basis {$b_j$}
\newline \math u = $u_1$$b_1$+$u_2$$b_2$+$u_3$$b_3$\) and \math v = $v_1$$b_1$+$v_2$$b_2$+$v_3$$b_3$\)
\newline Their inner product is given by \math u \cdot v = $u_1$$v_1$+$u_2$$v_2$+$u_3$$v_3$\)
\\
\\
\math u = \alpha $\hat{e}_1$
